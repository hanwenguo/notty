Weibian (simplified Chinese: 韦编; traditional Chinese: 韋編; Chinese Pinyin: wéi biān; IPA: \[weɪ˧˥ pjɛn˥˥\]; roughly “Way-Byen”) means the ancient Chinese technology of bookmaking. Before the invention of paper, Chinese scholars wrote on narrow vertical slips of bamboo or wood (simplified Chinese: 简牍; traditional Chinese: 簡牘) which were then bound together with leather straps to form a book. “韦” (weí) refers to the leather straps used to bind the bamboo slips, and “编” (biān) means to weave, bind, organize or compile. 

Just as leather straps bind scattered bamboo slips into a scroll, this project aims to weave your notes into a structured, cohesive knowledge base. The name is also a tribute to the spirit of learning and researching. According to《史记》 (_Shiji_, or the _Records of the Grand Historian_), Confucius studied《易经》(_Yijing_, or _I Ching_, or the _Book of Changes_) with such intensity that the leather bindings of his bamboo book wore out and snapped multiple times. The source text reads: “读《易》，韦编三绝” (“\[Confucius\] read the _Yijing_ \[so frequently that\] the leather bindings broke multiple times”). By naming this project Weibian, I honor both the structure of knowledge (the binding) and the persistence required to master it.
