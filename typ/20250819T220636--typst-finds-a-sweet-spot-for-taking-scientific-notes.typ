There are already plenty of note taking tools, and many of them have more or less support for taking notes of scientific thoughts. The bad news is that most of them, if not all, do not meet the criteria of taking scientific notes.

Typst, as a typesetting software with a domain-specific script language, or as a script language with typeset content as one of its basic value type and output target, has the ability to create modular, reusable snippets with enough control over typesetting. Its markup language and script language, by both producing content as values in the language, are congruent at a higher level. And its instant-preview is really impressive.
