Most of the note-taking software, especially those based by web techniques, has limited support for LaTeX simulation through MathJax or KaTeX. However, these simulations never satisfy one who tries to has any fine-grained control over mathematical typesetting. Anyone who wish to typeset mathematics in their notes seriously would need the full-power of it. This is not necessarily achieved using LaTeX, but at least one needs to use something that declares itself to be a full-power solution.
