# Notty: NOte Taking with TYpst

This is a working example for taking notes in the spirit of [Forester](https://www.forester-notes.org/index/index.xml) in [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst).

## Features

- [x] Transclusion of notes
- [x] Export to PDF and HTML
- [x] Integretation with [Emacs denote package](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote)
- [x] Dispatch metadata processing by taxonomy
- [x] Backmatters: backlinks, contexts, etc.

## TODO
- [ ] Better looking for backmatters
- [ ] TOC
- [ ] Bibliography support
    - [ ] Generate nodes for references
    - [ ] Reference section in backmatter
- [ ] Multiple authors & contributors
- [ ] Multilingual support
- [ ] Parallel building of notes
- [ ] Maybe in the future rewrite in Rust and use Typst as a library to be more flexible
